						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>
							During my minor in User Testing I delved deeper into what it means to truly test the potential of a product, design choices or even just a concept. User testing is an essential part of any design process, but feeling the effects firsthand with real world examples is wat strengthened this knowledge for me. The assignment was in Dutch and as such some of the image material is in Dutch, but all the relevant information is translated.
						</p>
						<h3>The client</h3>
						<p>
							Roadmap, a company that makes travel apps for big companies that can put their own brand on their framework. It combines the data of flight plans, hotels, travel options, agenda points, local restaurants and safety tips.
						</p>
						<h3>The challenge</h3>
						<p>
							The existing system has been designed and is already in use for some bigger companies. The leading developer however wants it tested by some fresh eyes as they lack their own user testing team in the company and would like feedback that is backed up by solid research.
						</p>
						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>
							A list of recommendations that is based off and backed by the pros and cons listed by the User Test with visual indications for the areas of improvement.
						</p>
						<h3>Length of the project</h3>
						<p>6 weeks side by side with 2 other projects in the same team.</p>
						<h3>Role</h3>
						<p>Heuristics tester, moderator.</p>

					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Research</h2>
						<p>
							During the research phase I searched for the best way to understand what  part of the current system needed to be tested. By speaking with the employees of Roadmap and getting the focus of the timeline part of the app that needs to be extensively tested, research questions were made.  The main research question was:
						</p>
						<blockquote class="align-center">
							“Which measures can be taken to improve the usability of the Roadmap application timeline.”
						</blockquote>
					</div>

					<p class="txt">
						The conversations with the employees of Roadmap made clear they had no clear idea about their own usability since they rarely do any user tests. The companies they provide the application for doesn’t want to let its employees get involved in User Testing. Both of these things factor in their inability to test the product themselves.
						From the main research question smaller research questions were comprise based off the heuristics done on the current timeline and app. These also each got their own concrete measurement questions which will directly get answered in the user test.

					</p>
					<ol class="txt">
						<li>How clear does the user think the timeline is</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Can the user book an Uber from the timeline?</li>
								<li>How many steps does the user take to achieve booking an Uber?</li>
							</ul>
						<li>What does the user think about the navigation within the software?</li>
							<ul>
								<li>How does the user experience searching for a restaurant in the vicinity?</li>
								<li>How long does it take the user to find the closest restaurants?</li>
								<li>How many steps does it take for the user to find a restaurant?</li>
							</ul>
						<li>What does the user think about the tabs with extra information in the timeline?</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Does the user notice that the appointments from the agenda communicate with the other aspects of the timeline?</li>
								<li>How does the user experience the communication between these elements on the timeline?</li>
							</ul>
					</ol>
					<p class="txt">
						After setting up the main research question and all the smaller questions from that point on to break the test down in smaller chunks the test was set up with scenario’s and test tasks. The 5 scenarios were  set up with no more  than 2 tasks each. They involve using only the timeline and are focused on answering the research questions.
					</p>
					
					<!-- The test -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>The Test</h2>
						<p>
							There were 5 candidates for the user test, as 5 is the recommended number by J. Nielsen who states that 5 is the ideal number to test to find most problems without being redundant. The test itself was positioned as seen below. Both the points listed for improvement as the positive feedback were given space to be listed throughout the test. This is visible for example in the post-test questionnaire where points for improvement are asked together with the question to list a positive note about the application. This way the test focusses on all the aspects, and not just what doesn’t work. It also really helps to include some positive feedback for the customers.

								Prior to the test the preperations were made. This is an image of the setup of the test itself which was made for the testplan.

						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/testscript.png" alt="The script of the test." />
							<figcaption>
								The script of the tests. THe general idea is that it introduces the people working on the test, present in that room. What will happen with the tests and the results, and a general introduction of what is tested. By having a 
								script ready for the users being tested the test is as similar as possible to remain credible and reproducable.

						</div>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/scenarios.png" alt="The scenarios." />
							<figcaption>
								This is a list of all the scenarios that were made to test the different aspects of the "timeline" portion of the Roadmap App.	
								The scenario's include actions such as booking an uber from the homescreen, using the agenda on the home screen, checking the local safety of travel locations and editing items such as existing agenda or dinner plans.

					<!--iterations  -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Iterations</h2>
						<p>
							During the first test a few question phrasings were incorrect and adjusted accordingly. Based on the pacing of this first test the other tests would also be measured. This means that the tests itself had a proper time set per scenario and task, and the task wasn’t poorly phrased or too obscure.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!-- results -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>The result</h2>
						<p>
							The result consists of a rapport with key highlights per scenario that were important and found in most/all user tests. It also houses a list of recommendations off of these findings. The findings are compartmentalized into a “could be adjusted” group and a “functions that could be added” group. With the former focusing on the most important aspects to improve and the latter on what could make the whole experience a better product altogether. All these recommendations are based and backed up by the user tests.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="image fit txt">
						<img src="images/textualrecommendations.png" alt="Recommendations." />
						<figcaption>
							A list of all the effective recommendations based on the user test. A key factor that returned in all aspects was consistency. With there being a new way to navigate or odd placement of buttons to mmisguide the users using the software.
							The listed recommendations are divided by "changes that could be made" and "functions that could be added." With the nature of this test and the rapport being recommendations no preset adjustments were made and only suggestions based off of the findings are shared.
							<br />
							The main changes that could be made were: 
							<ul>
								<li>A back button on the same location on every page.</li>
								<li>Creating consistency in the location of the escape hatch.</li>
								<li>Use consistent language (different words for the same functions on different pages).</li>
								<li>Unclear how to exit menu, the extra options on the timeline per seperate agenda point isn't defined enough</li>
								<li>Adjust location of weather option.</li>
							</ul>
							<br />
							The main functions that could be added were: 
							<ul>
								<li>Adding a search button.</li>
								<li>Adjusting a location after arrival manually.</li>
								<li>Create an option to customize the tabs.</li>
								<li>Add filter options.</li>
								<li>Having an overview of all the emergency contacts of said location (firedepartment, police, embassy etc).</li>
								<li>Declaration function as it is used for business traveling by big companies only.</li>
							</ul>
						</figcaption>
					</div>
					<p class="txt">
						The recommendations are then put into a visual form to help with the presentability and to get a better picture of the improvements. These are done per key recommendation and are edited within the visual layout of the app itself.
					</p>
					<div class="image fit txt">
						<img src="images/vrec1.png" alt="Visual recommendations 1" />
						<img src="images/vrec2.png" alt="Visual recommendations 2" />
						<img src="images/vrec3.png" alt="Visual recommendations 3" />
						<figcaption>
							These are the visual recommendations as they were noted in the rapport. The previously mentioned points were defined with visuals for added clarity. 
							Some visual edits were also made to showcase the recommended adjustments.
						</figcaption>
					</div>

					<!-- presentation -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Presentation</h2>
						<p>
							The presentation was held at the main office of Roadmap in Delft, where 2 key members of the organization would listen to the results as they were presented. The visuals from the recommendations were shown with the rest of the rapport backing up all the info and suggestions that were given.
						</p>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/presentatie0.png" alt="presentation positives" />
							<figcaption>
								This is a still of the presentation start where the users' positive remarks were listed. To start with an 
								uplifting mindset was the idea behind this sheet. 
							</figcaption>
						</div>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/presentatie1.png" alt="presentation adjustables" />
							<figcaption>
								This one is with all the adjustment points. Steering away from words such as "wrongs" or "mistakes" they are listed as 
								adjustable points to keep the positive idea for better reception and general communication.
							</figcaption>
						</div>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/presentatie2.png" alt="Presentation visual 3" />
							<img src="images/presentatie3.png" alt="Presentation visual 4" />
							<img src="images/presentatie4.png" alt="Presentation visual 5" />
							<figcaption>
								The visual recommendations put on a big sheet. For the purpose of the presentation the area's of focus were marked with a bright purple color. 
								The presentation needed fewer words because of this and could spark a topic of discussion/a conversation because of this.
							</figcaption>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- conclusion -->
					<div class="txt">	
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							The test itself was successful, a lot of useful information was given and processed accordingly. The information with the rapport can help Roadmap make their own adjustments and base them off data that is tested and accounted for. By making recommendations on what parts to focus on and improve without telling them how to improve it the role of a tester was fully embraced in this project.
