						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>
							During my minor in User Testing I also learned a great deal about the expert heuristic reviews. This assignment was about revisiting an existing financing system and reworking it to be more user friendly and intuitive by using a model of heuristics. The system is a website that manages and moderates the data linked to a platform that can distribute information and loans and such. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The assignment follows the discovering the situation, client and platform. Performing the heuristics and drawing a conclusion from that, and making suggestions and redesigns based on arguments from these heuristics. 
						</p>
						<h3>The client</h3>
						<p>
							Finventory. A company that manages the financing systems what banks and suppliers use to check, distribute and manage loans for outside companies. 
						</p>
						<h3>The challenge</h3>
						<p>
							The current system was unintuitive and has been made by developers without any the help of any designers. The task set out by Finventory was to create a revamped UI that doesn’t touch upon the overall color and navigation method.
						</p>
						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>
							A restructuring and remodeling of the existing system with similar style and colors, heavy focus on the usability. The new layout
						</p>
						<h3>Length of the project</h3>
						<p>6 weeks side by side with 2 other projects in the same team.</p>
						<h3>Role</h3>
						<p>Tester and lead presenter.</p>

					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Research</h2>
						<p>
							In the research phase I sought to understand the way that the system works now and what I could learn about the system to make it more user friendly. 
							The system itself works mostly on the background where it calculates most things automatically, the financers can use the software to manage and distribute the data present on the website. Finventory itself doesn’t know where the usability of their product can be improved as they state: “we are all developers looking at the product for too long and know it too well”. The main research question for this project was:
						</p>
						<blockquote class="align-center">
							“Which measures van be taken to increase the usability of the FinSys platform?”
						</blockquote>
					</div>

					<p class="txt">
						The sub-questions were then made to help answer the main question. They were made to help view the platform from the perspective of both sides of the user base. Not just the people that extend the loans but also those that receive them. 
					</p>
					<ol class="txt">
						<li>Which measurements can be taken to increase the usability of the “borrowing base” from the point of view of the loan taker?</li>
						<li>Which measurements can be taken to increase the usability of the “forms” from the point of view of the loan taker?</li>
						<li>Which measurements can be taken to increase the usability of the “borrowing base” from the point of view of the loan distributor?</li>
						<li>Which measurements can be taken to increase the usability of the “forms” from the point of view of the loan distributor?</li>
						<li>What are the findings related to the field of navigation?</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="txt">
						There were also specific pages that were requested to be reviewed. Therefore, there’s specific pages incorporated in the sub-questions above.
					</p>
					
					<!-- main heuristics -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Heuristics Test</h2>
						<p>
							The heuristics is how the test got to its fruition. The used heuristics were the 247 web usability guidelines. These are ideal because of its extensive and intricate nature. The test itself has 247 questions, or checkboxes. These are divided by 9 subjects. For the purpose of the test for fynsis these have been reduced to the 5 subjects that were most relevant to the pages and functions that needed to be tested. The 5 subjects of the test were:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Task orientation </li>
							<li>Navigation & information architecture </li>
							<li>Forms & data entry</li>
							<li>Writing & content quality</li>
							<li>Page layout & visual design</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<!--Recommendations  -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Recommendations</h2>
						<p>
							After the separate tests, the team put their results together. ¬The heuristics were fruitful as they displayed a lot of room for improvement in broad and in specific areas. With the amount of time versus the amount of improvements that could be made while keeping the system looking mostly like it does now. The results had key highlights and points of improvement for each one of the 5  subjects. After this the results of all tests were combined into one bigger list of highlights per subject. These findings would serve as a baseline for the visual recommendations. MoSCoW was used to rank the findings in order of importance right now. This way the “Must haves” and the “Should Haves” have the priority while the “Could haves” and “Would haves” are provided to the customer to look into after the project finishes.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!-- Presentation -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Presentation and results</h2>
						<p>
							The presentation housed the whole company of Finventory. They requested it to be a “sparring session” where instead of a slide by slide presentation it would be a discussion based off the results and suggestions. It would be an answer to the sub and then main research question. While the visuals and the overarching discussion was the main answer to the research question, it was also answered in a short manner below to support the documentation. The answer to most questions is the same in its base form with some adjustments because the center of all the findings is that the layout improvement can change the whole usability aspect of this project.  
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="txt">
						<ol>
							<li>Which measurements can be taken to increase the usability of the “borrowing base” from the point of view of the loan taker?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The layout of the website should be optimized first. Buttons need to be clearly defined.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Which measurements can be taken to increase the usability of the “forms” from the point of view of the loan taker?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The layout of the website should be optimized first.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Which measurements can be taken to increase the usability of the “borrowing base” from the point of view of the loan distributor?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The layout of the website should be optimized first.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Which measurements can be taken to increase the usability of the “forms” from the point of view of the loan distributor?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The layout of the website should be optimized first. There should be only one filter option available.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>What are the findings related to the field of navigation?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The navigation bar on the left side of the webpage takes up a lot of space. The navigation is also not user friendly because of submenus hidden in main menu items, you must click to expand instead of hovering. There is no “current location” present in the main menu</li>
								</ul>
						</ol>
						<p>
							And the main question: “Which measures van be taken to increase the usability of the FinSys platform?” is answered with all the questions above combined and the visuals.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!-- conclusion -->
					<div class="txt">	
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							In the results there was a point of improvement: consistency. After that the other improvements are less important. When the system is more consistent it helps the usability far more than any other adjustments that could have been made. The things like buttons needing to look like buttons are also part of this consistency, as it all stems from the navigation benefits that come from the betterment of the consistency.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was a fun project to work on and especially the final presentation which lasted about one and a half hours because of its “discussion” nature was a great time. It gave insights to both us researchers and the people at Finventory which never looked at the usability aspect of their product. It was great to get positive feedback on all the work that was done and to see they wanted to move forward and were “revitalized” as it were in their goal to achieve better usability.
