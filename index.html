						<p><span class="image right"><img id="profile" src="images/ik.png" alt="" /></span>	I’m Jeroen, a twentysomething year old studying CMD (Communication Multimedia Design) at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. I’m working on becoming great at making systems that don’t just work, but work well with the users being center in this process.
							My relevant history consists of a 4-year education in graphic design, a 6 months internship in Seoul, South-Korea, my current education in the world of UX Design and some motion graphics designing in between. The combination of these elements give me a diverse toolkit that help me see the bigger picture from different angles and come up with more creative solutions.
							In my spare time I dabble with pencils, cameras, guitars, languages and Netflix. I love the outdoors and the sun that is usually present, always thought I’d like it more in a tropical country. Capturing the places I visit on camera is a great way for me to create memorabilia for me to look back on and to try to see every place I visit in a different way. I have lived near a beach, a forest, a metropolis and am now searching to expand that repertoire with the bustling city of Jakarta.

					<h1>CMD</h1>
					<p>Communication Multimedia Design</p>
				</header>
				<p class="left">An acronym for Communication Multimedia Design. More often than not it’s referred to as UX designer, even though it’s very similar but not exactly the same. CMD is more focused on making a system that works perfectly from the perspective of the user than the counterparts of UX design, which is why it is named differently. User friendly is key. I am a student learning the trade at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. </p>
				<p class="left">In my time at The Hague university of applied sciences I learned all kinds of tools, the entire process of how to make a user-centered design and how to combine the two into a working process. It gets divided in four phases in this education:</p>

							<h3>2. Create Concepts </h3>

							<h3>3. Design Details</h3>
							<p>The phase where the first visuals start appearing related to the project. Wireframes, flowcharts, styletiles, sitemaps and so on. As the name implies, it relies heavily on the details of the design part, a very visual phase.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>4. Realize</h3>
							<p>Here the product gets realized into a high-fidelity prototype as close to the final product as possible. With tests done and polish being added it represents what the project was about.</p>

					<h2>My experience with this process</h2>
				</header>
				<p class="left">In the beginning it was difficult for me to separate these phases. When a new assignment is given it’s easy to instantly have an idea of how to visualize it, finish it and polish it. The thing that I mainly learned after a lot of practice which I think is the most valuable asset for me is the ability to separate these initial thoughts and ideas and focus on a healthy dose of research to make sure that what I make is good for the user, and not just me. If I had to give a name to this lesson it would be: “I am not the target audience.” With this in mind it becomes more of an unknown, and speculations can be present, but everything should be based on what I can back up with claims and research. This keeps it interesting and fun for me as every different project has a different target audience and different things for me to learn about and to reason from.</p>
				<p class="left">This on its own was a new way for me to experience a creative process, allowing for more freedom in creating something while not losing sight on the how or the why. From the process the conceptualizing phase is one of my 3 favorites. It is a hard one to get into because it needs to be specific enough to not be general nonsense, but broad enough to be applicable to an entire project and not be a very particular overly detailed design. Followed by this would be the wireframing phase. It’s a quick and messy phase with all that data, information and a concept backing the visuals you create at that point. With a lot of wiggle room to see what can be drawn up and how this could impact the user flow, the paper prototype testing of these wireframes and the iterations. A whole stack of potential creative paperwork. The final favorite of mine would be the user testing. While there is always a chance that this phase might tell the entire project “we messed up a few steps ago” and sends you straight back to the drawing board it can also enforce the design thusfar, motivate and improve what has already been made and offer a lot of new perspectives. This is a part of the unknown for me that keeps UX interesting.</p>
