						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>
							The teachers of the ROC Mondriaan school need a better and more direct way to get help with digital problems when they arise in front of the classroom. The IT department can be busy, and it can take up to 3 days for a request to be honored and immediate help is difficult to find with classes that last only 50 minutes. This means that any difficulties can really hurt the productive time spent on a class. 
						</p>
						<p>
							In this assignment the contextual features of a phone are used to solve the problem written above. It uses automated scripts, NFC and the available help from colleagues rather than the IT department to solve this issue. The result is a contextual aware app with problem reporting and social help signals.
						</p>
						<h3>The client</h3>
						<p>
							ROC Mondriaan, a provider of education all around the central western part of the Netherlands. They have over 200 educations.
						</p>
						<h3>The challenge</h3>
						<p>
							Create a Hi-fi prototype in a short amount of time with proper User Testing, a system that the users actually want to use and one that solves the aforementioned problems.
						</p>
						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>
							An app that uses NFC and wifi location to help fix technical problems with automated scripts. If that doesn’t work it will attempt to send help of “digicoaches”, which are self-registered colleagues that are on call one day a week as IT help.
						</p>
						<h3>Length of the project</h3>
						<p>10 weeks</p>
						<h3>Role</h3>
						<p>Planner of the schedule, lead interviewer and designer.</p>

						<h2>Research</h2>
						<p>
							In the research phase I sought to understand the perspective and the needs of the user. The assignment was given by the application management department of ROC Mondriaan, they govern over the IT of all the locations. They would like us to make this application, and as such it has no information yet on what the end users will think/feel about the problem and its struggles. The main research question was:
						</p>
						<blockquote class="align-center">
							“How can the technical challenges that the teachers of ROC Mondriaan face be resolved while meeting their needs?”
						</blockquote>
					</div>

					<p class="txt">
						The following sub-questions were made to answer the main research question:
					</p>
					<ol class="txt">
						<li>What are the needs of the teachers of ROC Mondriaan regarding their technological challenges?</li>
						<li>How can the technical needs of the teachers of ROC Mondriaan be solved?</li>
						<li>What is the biggest technical challenge that the teachers of ROC Mondriaan face?</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="txt">
						The research had several phases. In the first  phase as an interview was set up with the people of Application Management and several interviews with the target audience thereafter, a small survey was made. To peek behind the curtain and to get some starting information and what to base the interviews themselves on. A google questionnaire was made with 4 short questions to get a high response rate and mailed to approximately 50 teachers, 21 of which responded. The responses from these questionnaires were mostly simple and technical in nature. It also housed a question on what they would like to receive from the IT department and how to improve the service related to IT.
						There was also an interview with the manager of the digital environment, blackboard, to get an understanding of the other side of the IT requests. The information from the 21 surveys, and this interview were compiled into a combined list to show which answers are frequent and what the common pattern is. The result of which turned into the topic list which would be used to have extended, open interviews with the Application management team and teachers of ROC Mondriaan in person. 

					</p>
					<p class="txt">
						The interviews were one of the most important parts of the research. They verified some information from the previous quick poll such as the beamer problems. Most importantly they gave a lot of new insights. The insights gathered from these interviews can be summarized as the need for solutions are only half there. The target audience isn’t very keen on always carrying a cellphone with them at all times, even if it is from work. Interviewed candidates vary widely in their knowledge of IT and this also posed a possible new group for solutions. As other teachers which are good at IT also offer their services in the IT helping department one day a week via a program called “DigiCoaches”. The interviews also showed a need for simplicity, it was stated several times that standing in front of a class of 20-30 students with only 50 minutes of class means that every minute must count. There were more findings, but these were the ones that  stood out the most and would translate to the concepting phase.
					</p>
					<p class="txt">
						The results of the research were combined into user needs in MoSCoW order. The most important user needs would then be translated into personas to encapsulate the target audience. The User needs in this image are in Dutch, but the translated version of the top 4Must Have user needs are:
					</p>
					<ol class="txt">
						<li>As a teacher I want to connect my laptop/tablet to the beamer so that I can easily write on the board.</li>
						<li>As a teacher I would like to send IT problem reports easily so I don’t lose time on my other duties.</li>
						<li>As the IT Department I want the technical problems reported through the official channels so that everything can be registered at the main office.</li>
						<li>As the IT Department I want to spend as little time as possible on small IT issues so I have time for the bigger more important issues.</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="txt">
						This brings the center of the research and interviews into 4 pretty concrete user needs. The teachers experience the most problems in beamer connectivity, spend as little time on the official channels to report faulty hardware or software issues and want everything done with as little effort as possible. The IT Department wants teachers to call them only when the problem is big enough because of their workload and states that smaller issues can often easily be resolved with a reboot or by other colleagues.
					</p>
					
					<!-- concepting -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Concepting</h2>
						<p>
							The concepting started with a 6-3-5 method brainstorming in the group. The ideas would be passed around and turned into 3 tangible concepts. Of the three concepts the concept enforcing the simple solutions, as it was called at this point, made the final cut. This concept leans on the simplicity of applying a fix to any technical problem. With a minimalistic amount of information, a maximum amount of results. The idea was to have a background process that is complicated that doesn’t involve the user, this could be anything like an algorithm-based problem-solving system to an automatic data-extractor for reporting issues or faulty equipment. The end-result was a concept called “One-Tap” as it leans on the simplicity where it wants the users’ problems to go away with as little effort as possible. Or with one tap, as it were.
						</p>
						<p">
							For the clarification a concrete scenario, a task model and a storyboard had been drawn up. This is done to give an image to the concept as its presented to the customer for the “go or no-go”. This was done in a videocall where the basic concept was shown with the visuals. The research behind the concept was summarized shortly and the personas were shown. After the “go” was given the project continued towards the wireframes phase.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!--wireframing  -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Wireframing and Designing details</h2>
						<p>
							The wireframing phase started out with a few different sketches and mockups based on the concrete scenario from the concepting phase. To keep the simplicity key and center the functions started out as minimalistic as possible. The schools itself have NFC readers all around the building. Every beamer has one, the laptops have them integrated, almost every phone has one, printers use it and even opening a classroom goes via NFC. The screens to work out existed of the main NFC reader which would apply quick fixed by holding the device against any NFC reader. It also housed an agenda function where scanning a room would display if the classroom was free or not, and what its schedule was. The final option would be to trigger the help signal which would enlist the help of a Digicoach to your location to offer immediate assistance with an important problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some functions didn’t make it to the wireframe after the first wireframe iteration such as the schedule checker. This function was scrapped because of the direction the app needed to go in. To maintain its simplicity its core function should be solving problems. These problems vary from being an immediate, big problem to a smaller problem to a problem that can be solved later. The wireframes were given color and cleaned up. These were also turned into a lo-fi prototype to start the user testing with. A styletile was also created to support the basic designs based off the colors used by ROC Mondriaan. These colors, paired with a very minimalistic and neutral color scheme to always keep the priority of the main action on a screen clear, enforcing what the main action is on any given screen.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!-- user testing -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>User testing</h2>
						<p>
							The user testing was performed on 5 teachers. The tests were set up with a pre-test questionnaire, main scenarios and tasks based on the main tasks the users should be able to perform in the application. From these tests a lot of faults in the design emerged and would be iterated into better wireframes. These would, in turn, be turned into the hi-fi prototype. Some of the most important findings were of items and functions that were lacking because of the oversimplification, which are as follows:
						</p>
					</div>

					<ol class="txt">
						<li>No menu for extra functions.</li>
						<li>There is no way to see past actions, such as help requests or tickets.</li>
						<li>No status indicator for the requested help and who will arrive when, there is also no way to cancel this.</li>
						<li>The names on buttons aren’t clear enough, what is the function/urgency of buttons?</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="txt">
						With that top 4 the core design of simplicity could be kept up but should be expanded in a way that allows for more functionality.
					</p>

					<!-- hi-fi and prototype -->
					<div class="txt">
						<h2>Hi-fi prototype, the final product</h2>
						<p>
						The hi-fi prototype, based on all the previous findings in the user test, would be the final product delivered to the customer. The result of the project was an app that runs a script on the background to reset hardware, re-connect the wifi settings or other small fixed that the IT department has stated to resolve most of the issues in earlier interviews. When this function doesn’t work calling for help from a colleague/digicoach is the go-to option. The other core functionality of the app is reporting problems that don’t need immediate tending to. A broken mouse/keyboard, a slow functioning computer, a beamer that has a fading light that needs replacing and so on. Making a ticket in this system is quick, it automatically fills in the device (if scanned) and location to decrease the effort it takes to report something, enforcing the One-Tap concept. A possibility to include a picture with the ticket option and a history tab to view open tickets.

					<!-- conclusion -->
					<div class="txt">	
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							It was a bigger project with a more limited timeframe. Working an assignment with a varying target audience is always an interesting challenge. Getting the point of view from a certain angle that is not your own is always a rewarding experience that gives many insights I myself would not have thought of. The research phase is, for me, one of the most interesting parts because of this. Every assignment has a different audience and different things to learn. This assignment had more online aspects than other projects I previously worked on because of the global lockdown with COVID-19. This meant that a few of the user tests were done remotely which proved to be a whole new challenge to get proper results with. Contact with the customer and presentations were  alsodone digitally. It was a good experience and an interesting project to work on. The app is meant to be a base product for the IT department to give to their superiors as a suggestion for a project that could help the employees
